In 2009, he started his Electrical Engineering course at the [Federal University of Ceara](https://www.ufc.br/).

He was approved in July 2012 to do a 14-month exchange in Germany, in the city of Cologne, studying Renewable Energies at the [Cologne University of Applied Sciences](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/homepage_26.php).

Got his Bachelor's degree in 2014 and proceeded with his Master's degree in the research area of Control & Automation, concluding it in 2017.

He was a full-professor at [UniFanor University Center](https://www.unifanor.edu.br/unifanor), where he ministred courses of Electrical Engineering.

In 2018 he started his PhD at UFC by composing an R&D group at the GPAR-UFC laboratory.
