## About me

Adriano Rodrigues de Paula was born in Caucaia, in the near from Fortaleza city -- Brazil. Since childhood he has been very interested in learning new _hobbies_ and acquiring diverse knowledge in mathematics, biology, history, and geography. However, it was in the technology field that he found his identity, always seeking to satisfy his curiosity about any sort of mechanisms and electronics.

In 2009, he started his Electrical Engineering undergraduation curse at the [Federal University of Ceara](https://www.ufc.br/) -- UFC with the goal of working with Electric Vehicles or Renewable Energy at that time. Since his first year of college, he became fascinated with programming and theoretical mathematics, drawing the attention from professors and colleagues due to his affinity on these subjects. However, he stuck to his goal of working with Renewable Energies.

Yet early in his undergraduation, he was elected for the Scientific Initiation scholarship by the Renewable Energy Laboratory at the Electrical Engineering department, simultaneously with the approval for the mentoring fellowship spot of the discipline of Microprocessors & Microcontrollers. The deadlock was solved in favor of Scientific Initiation in Renewable Energies, where he worked with a desalination system via reverse osmosis and continued with the renewal of his scholarship with the input data processing for a neural network to predict wind power potential.

In July 2012, as result of a lot of dedication, he was approved to a exchange scholarship in Germany, in the city of Cologne. He studied Renewable Energies in the Electrical Engineering department of the [University of Applied Sciences Cologne](https://www.th- koeln.de/en/homepage_26.php) -- TH Köln, a reference in the field, where he stayed for 14 months and learned mainly about solar, wind and biomass energy.

However, he never put aside his taste for programming and theoretical mathematics. The opportunity of the Microprocessor mentoring fellowship spot that he chose not to take on has never been forgotten. Thus, when he returned from Germany, he found himself again in the field of Control & Automation, as it was full of microprocessors, microcontrollers, programming, and theoretical mathematics. He then decided to complete his undergraduation already in the subject of Control & Automation and became a member of the [Research Group on Automation, Control and Robotics](https://gpar.ufc.br/) -- GPAR. Then, he started his master's degree soon after, in 2015, still in this research field.

Upon finishing his master's degree in 2017, he gained experience as professor at [UniFanor University Center](https://www.unifanor.edu.br/unifanor), where he taught in total more than 10 different subjects of Electrical Engineering for students of the courses of Electrical, Control & Automation, Mechanical and Chemical engineering. His prominence led to a promotion to full-time professor, which gave him an administrative role along with the coordination of the Electrical Engineering course.

In 2018, he left the majistery due to the invitation of his former undergraduate and master's advisor, prof. PhD. Fabrício Gonzalez Nogueira, to compose a [Research & Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development) -- R&D group inside GPAR's dependecies and, at the same time, start his doctorate, still in the ​​Control & Automation research field.

During his R&D and PhD timespan, he improved his computational skills using programming languages ​​like Python, C++, JavaScript and markup languages ​​like HTML, CSS, Markdown and LaTeX, among many other computational tools.
